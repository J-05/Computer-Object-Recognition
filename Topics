TRAVEL and TOURISM

Image recognition can be useful in public transport, especially in airports where checking for prohibited items is a manual process done by people. Using computer software that can automatically detect prohibited items can speed up the process, increasing efficiency and consumer satisfaction. However, they may not be completely reliable as computers may fail to recognise abnormal images or obstructed images. Therefore, a risk presented by this could be that complications and safety issues could be caused in the event of a computer malfunction.

GAMING and ENTERTAINMENT

Image recognition can present developments in the gaming and entertainment sector. Image recognition could allow the detection of a person's movements or actions, introducing a new means of gameplay. It could also be implemented in VR to integrate the player's real life environment into the game through image recognition of their surroundings. Limitations of image recognition is that motion sensors could be considered more reliable to detect movements with more accuracy. Furthermore, the technology could be too expensive to integrate into gaming devices at an affordable price.

EDUCATION and LEARNING

Computers can be specialised to recognise and store information about objects related to a subject in education. For example, medical students could use this software to scan parts of the body which the computer can then provide information about. It can be also used for younger children in aiding and correcting their work, such as in mathematics. However, this could cause a lack of willingness to memorise content and cause them to be indolent with their work due to their reliance on this software.

TRANSPORT and NAVIGATION

Image recognition can be used to allow self-driving cars to operate by detecting traffic, pedestrians, signs and traffic lights to maneuver the car safely and efficiently. In a society where self driving cars are the norm, accidents and errors can be minimised, while also increasing efficiency due to the lack of need for traffic lights and other human aid. A limitation to using image recognition is that the software is susceptible to errors and malfunction which could cause safety concerns to arise.

MEDICINE and HEALTHCARE

The ability to detect objects with computers can be extremely helpful in identifying objects smaller than the naked eye can see, and especially in places difficult to access. This can aid in surgeries and potentially be used to target cancer cells in cancer treatment. However, this technology may be difficult to implement at such small scales and must versaille in different environments.
